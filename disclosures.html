            <h2>Effective Date: July 01, 2023</h2>
            <p>The Bitmap Protocol is still experimental. Development is not a guarantee of adoption, financial returns,
                or technical feasibility. By proceeding, you agree that any and all liability for risks resulting from
                investment transactions, ecosystem interactions, or other asset dispositions is entirely on you (and
                that the security of your digital property, assets, and finances is your sole responsibility).</p>

            <h2>Vision and Roadmap</h2>
            <p>Our vision, roadmap, and projections are based on research, consultations, information received,
                sentiment analysis, and feasibility studies. There is no playbook, hence we will innovate as we build.
                We may need to design original tools to bring our vision to life, and we don't know how compatible this
                will be for native Bitcoin Blocks development. As a result, our timeline can be unpredictable. New tools
                or narratives can evolve that will affect our development methodologies.</p>

            <h2>Transaction Risks</h2>
            <p>In view of the high risks, you should only carry out such transactions if you understand the nature of
                the contracts (and contractual relationships) you are entering into and if you are able to fully assess
                the extent of your risk potential. We recommend that you contact your personal financial advisor before
                carrying out specific transactions and investments.</p>

            <h2>Development Team Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Don't get in for the rewards. Get in for the experience... We assure our members of transparency,
                accountability, and 100% commitment to achieve the vision of the BitcoinOGs Club and its associated
                product ecosystem. We believe in Bitcoin, and when/if the Bitcoin Metaverse ever becomes a thing in the
                future, we will ensure to be a top-5 notable entity by our quality, persistence, technical flexibility,
                and storytelling.</p>
            <p>We want to push for a sense of community by building an exclusive, multi-sensory adventure to a limited
                audience; while applying improvisational strategies to ensure a low cost, yet fluid experience and a
                unique product/value narrative. Although there is no guarantee to all of this, we believe that with the
                unwavering support of our members and community, we will be the APEX Club for Bitmap OGs.</p>
